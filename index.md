Howdy!
After a long time, I wanted to change the landing page of my website. The last version was from 2017, when I was a student. At that time, I had a lot of energy, but less things to put here.

I would not say now I have a lot of things to put here, but I think it's time to change the landing page.


At this point, I'm not sure what to write here. I'm just going to put some stats and some links to my projects. I hope, I will revisit this quickly to put some meaningful content here.
